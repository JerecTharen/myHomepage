Just a personal project to help make my life a bit more convenient

Functionality I want:
1.Display a different background or picture depending on the date and/or time (Complete)
2.Keep track of school browser tabs and personal browser tabs
3.Act as a calendar I can schedule events on, and keep track of their progress (i.e personal and school projects)
4.(Optional)Maybe add some fun little extras like a motivational video or intriguing fact or other such wanted information

I can make this a one page app where there is a part that will display all backgrounds, and then a part that will show
a calendar of tasks, and then the main page which will have minimalist/overviews of all components. For example,
progress bars for the tasks on the calendar will be on the main page.
